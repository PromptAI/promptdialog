## What is Timed Taskï¼Ÿ

------
Do you encounter the following problems?
- Release the service every morning to make the daily update take effect
- Before work in the morning, the FAQ/Flows are already trained to have a direct conversation


For the above-mentioned similar periodical work, we have developed the Timed Task function.

- Optional release/debug
- Optional FAQ/Dialog flows
- task enable/pause
- Multiple tasks exist at the same time
- The task takes effect within the specified date

Two cycle modes supported:
- Cron Expression
- Fixed time Interval

### Cron Express

------

A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows:

| Field Name | Mandatory | Allowed Values | Allowed Special Characters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Seconds | YES | 0-59 | , - \* / |
| Minutes | YES | 0-59 | , - \* / |
| Hours | YES | 0-23 | , - \* / |
| Day of month | YES | 1-31 | , - \* ? / L W
|
| Month | YES | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | , - \* / |
| Day of week | YES | 1-7 or SUN-SAT | , - \* ? / L # |
| Year | NO | empty, 1970-2099 | , - \* / |

So cron expressions can be as simple as this: \* \* \* \* ? \*

or more complex, like this: 0/5 14,18,3-39,52 \* ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010

Examples

Here are some full examples:

### Fixed time Interval

------

Periodic execution is performed at fixed intervals in seconds.

## Concept

Common Settings:

- Mode                         : Fixed time interval or Cron
- Enable                       : Enable this task or not 
- Train Type                   : Debug or Release
- Trainable Module             : Participating modules
- Task execution time interval : Tasks can run during this time period

Optional Settings:

- Fixed time interval :

```text
`Fixed time interval (Second)` need to be set

- Positive integer
- Mix: 100
```

- Cron Expression:

```text
`Custom (Corn)` need to be set

- a valid cron expression
```

## How to use?

------

### Release at 00:00 every day

### Release every 72 hours
