### During a conversation, I want to output different responses according to different user inputs. What should I do?
There are several ways to do it.

Solution 1: Branching a dialog flow, and add a condition in each branch.  The condition could be whether a slot value is null. Please refer to [Bot Reply Conditions](/docs/tutorial/flow_agent/reply_conditions/).

Solution 2: Different slot values trigger different responses. Please refer to [Conditional Responses](/docs/advance_control/conditional_response/).  This solution can reduce the number of branches displayed in your flow.

Solution 3: Calling Webhook. The response is dynamically generated by the value retrieved by calling [webhook](/docs/webhook/01-webhook/). For example, query the balance of an account.
