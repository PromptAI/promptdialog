### How do I get the URL when I customize the webhook?

Please refer to the tutorial [webhook](/docs/tutorial/webhook/01-webhook/)

### How to create consecutive multiple responses?

Please refer to the tutorial [Create conversation flow graph - add reply node](/docs/tutorial/flow/01-create-flow/#add-reply-node)

### Do not know the function of intents template

Please refer to the tutorial [Create Intent List](/docs/tutorial/node-template/user-global/)

### Does the initial node of the flow chart have a user option by default?

Please refer to the tutorial [Dialog Flow Graph Settings](/docs/tutorial/setting/)

### Add a node and then delete it. Is there an undo function?

Please refer to the tutorial [Undo/Redo](/docs/tutorial/setting/)

-->
### Can the bot reply with an attachment?
Yes. Please refer to the tutorial [Create a dialog flow - Add an attachment to the bot response](/docs/tutorial/flow/).

### Can I fill multiple slots in one sentence? For example, "I want five pounds of apples"
Yes. You can annotate multiple slots in the training examples of the Bot node.

Please refer to the tutorial:
- Form: [Fill-multiple-slots-in-one-sentence](/docs/tutorial/form/#can-i-fill-multiple-slots-in-one-sentence). 

### During a conversation, I want to output different responses according to different user inputs. What should I do?
There are several ways to do it. 

Solution 1: Branching a dialog flow, and add a condition in each branch.  The condition could be whether a slot value is null. Please refer to [Bot Reply Conditions](/docs/zh/tutorial/advance_control/reply_conditions/). 

Solution 2: Different slot values trigger different responses. Please refer to [Conditional Responses](/docs/zh/tutorial/advance_control/Conditional Responses).  This solution can reduce the number of branches displayed in your flow. 

Solution 3: Calling Webhook. The response is dynamically generated by the value retrieved by calling [webhook](/docs/tutorial/webhook/02-webhook/). For example, query the balance of an account. 

Solution 4: Using Action. [Action](/docs/tutorial/tutorial/bot_action/) can be added to the bot response, and different responses can be realized through Python code.

### Can we add our own projects to the Project Templates?
Temporarily, this feature is not enabled.

### ### Can the node convert the type?

Currently, only user input can be converted to a button,
You can change the "user input method" of the user input node to "click input"

### Shortcut key support: control c/z

You can use control c to quickly copy nodes to the pasteboard, and control z to undo the previous operation

### The node has errors and cannot be saved

If there is an error in a node, click `Save` when editing the node, and an error message will appear. If you want to use a node first, you can click `Close`

### Can I debug modules in parallel?
Currently, it is not supported due to potential conflicts. 

### It seems emoticons are not supported. 
Yes. Currently, emoticons are not supported. Please stay tuned.
