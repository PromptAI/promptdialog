### Can it be installed on different machines?
An agent can only be installed on one computer. If you have multiple computers, you will need to create a corresponding number of agents and install them separately on each computer.

### How to uninstall the agent
The agent not in use can be uninstalled through the "Manage Agents" management panel.

<!--- 正在使用的Agent不能通过"Manage Agents"管理面板删除，需要在安装机器中执行卸载命令。 当卸载命令执行完成后，"Manage Agents"中的Agent将会被删除。

<!--
The agent in use cannot be deleted through the "Manage Agents" management panel.  The uninstall command needs to be executed on the machine where the agent is installed.  When the uninstallation command is executed, the agent in "Manage Agents" will be deleted.

- Note: You need to keep the network unobstructed when executing the uninstall command。 

### How to upgrade the agent?
