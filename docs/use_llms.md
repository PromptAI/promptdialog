You can config your OpenAI API Key on our platform or use the tokens we purchased from OpenAI. If you have other need, please contact us: [info@promptai.us](mailto:info@promptai.us)

Tokens will be consumed during the training and conversations. Currently,  `100,000` free tokens will be given to each registered user to start. PromptAI is LLMs-native; it will leverage LLMs everywhere to improve the conversation quality.  For example, OpenAI tokens will be used:
- Text embedding
- Flow control
- Slot filling

### Flow:
Pretrained LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 will dramatically improve conversation quality.  In zero or few shot training,  ChatGPT performs much better than the DIET algorithm in RASA in terms of intent classification and entity recognition.

### 4. Do I need to retrain after turning off the LLMs mode?
> Yes. After enabling or disabling LLMs, debug/run/re-publish your project is required.

### 5. What's a token?
