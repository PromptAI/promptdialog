# Quickly build a website assistant using a Web (URL) and FAQ
We take PromptAI's [Help Document](https://doc.promptai.us/docs/about/) as a sample knowledge source, add a few frequently asked FAQs, and launch a website assistant. 
If you do not have a PromptAI account, please [click to register](https://app.promptai.us/register) to create account. Otherwise, [Click to log in](https://app.promptai.us/login).

1. After logging in to the system, click `Create Project` in the upper right corner. Please input the project information, e.g., 
- Name: PromptAI Website Assistant
- Description: Help customers who are searching the PromptAI website
- Welcome: Welcome to PromptAI! Is there any question I can assist you with?

2. Add the entire website as a knowledge source: After entering the project, click `Knowledge Base` - `Web` - `Add` to to add the url of the website your customers would like to query.

## Release and Conversation
After two simple steps, we completed the construction of a knowledge base:
- Added and parsed the PromptAI help documentation: https://doc.promptai.us/docs/about/
- Added an FAQ: Who are you?

### Release
Next, proceed to release the bot: click `Project Tool` - `Release` in the left pane to enter the bot release management interface

## Statistics

PromptAI provides users with a report function, and users can view the usage of the assistant, including the number of visits, Q&A volume, etc.

## Tips
Not only does it support webpages, PromptAI also supports other types of knowledge bases: Text and File. These different types of knowledge bases can be combined to answer user questions.
