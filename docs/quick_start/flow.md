We can expand [the Website Assistant](/docs/quick_start/knowledge_base/) to include a few IT Helpdesk functions. For
example,

- Automatically display user's name
- Submit a ticket if it is not able to answer a user question (Fallback)
- No need to repeatedly obtain the user's `email` when creating a ticket

## Create a Flow

The flow asks for the user's email address and his question and then generates a ticket.

Implementation:

- [Text tutorial](/docs/tutorial/form/)
- [Video Tutorial](/docs/example/form/)

## Automatically load user's name

After the user logs in to the system, the user's name and email address can be set to Session Storage or Local Storage
through key-Value. PromptAI can obtain the user's name and email address from these two places and use them in Flow.

Stepsï¼š

1. After the user logs in to the system, write the user's name and email address into Local Storage

```text
name : PromptAI-User
email: info@promptai.us
```

2. Set `name` and `email` respectively in [Slot default value](/docs/tutorial/slot_config/#default-value)

* The configured key needs to be consistent with the key written to Local Storage.

## Fallback

PromptAI supports adding a button below the default reply to link to Flow or FAQ.

Use this function to connect Fallback with Service Flow. When Fallback appears, users can click the button to submit a
work order.

### Fallback connects to Service Flow

Click `Overview-Fallback-Buttons for fallbacks-Add` to add Service Flow button to fallback.

Modify Service Flow and go directly to submit tickets

Modify the Bot node to display `name` and `email`

## Run

Realization effect:

- Automatically obtain the `name` and `email` of the logged-in user
- The logged-in user displays `name` in the welcome message: PromptAI-User
- Click the `Service` button below Fallback to submit a ticket directly
- Submitting a ticket does not ask for `email` repeatedly. After submission, the automatically filled `info@promptai.us`
  is displayed.
