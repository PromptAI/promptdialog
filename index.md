# Welcome to Prompt AI
{: .no_toc .header }

We present PromptDialog, an LLMs-native integrated development (IDE) and operation environment (DevOps) to enable rapid development and delivery of AI assistants, aka, chatbots.

<!-- 
When you are using Rasa Open Source, you might be disappointed by the lack of Large Language Modelsâ€™ support (LLMs) and the missing of GUIs that provides low code user interface for flow design.  When you are using LLMs, you might be concerned on how to embed your own business logic in LLMs.  This is exactly what we experienced when building AI assistants for financial institutes and car manufacturers. -->

PromptDialog supports LLMs including ChatGPT and GPT4, together with a design/testing/deployment environment.  With PromptDialog, we aim to bring you an AI experience with the latest LLMs technology and significant reduction (90%) of development cost. PromptDialog is an LLMs-native AI assistant development environment, meaning it builds everything on LLMs including dialog flow, knowledge base, and dialog state management.  Using this architecture, your assistant's performance will improve with the latest advancements in LLMs (both proprietary and open source).  And the most important, it is free!  Here are a few highlights:

* Intuitive business logic design. The dialog flows can be described in text or drawn explicitly, not as vague as annotated conversations or python programs anymore.  It can be displayed and shared with your team members.
* All-in-one DevOps: Design, develop and operate conversations, on premises or cloud, in one platform.
* Zero shot intent classification and entity recognition, less or even no annotation required.
